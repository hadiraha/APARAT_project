# APARAT_project
This is my first real project.
This is a crawler on APARAT website.
You can find the profiles info by using this code and store data on your db.
You need to add a decent scheduler to run this crawler automatically. ALready project lacks the scheduler.
I will invite you to contribute to let me know how to write a scheduler for running this project.
